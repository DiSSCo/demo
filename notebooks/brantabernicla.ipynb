    "*A brant goose (Branta bernicla) was collected by G. D. Hanna from St. Paul Island, Pribilof Islands, Alaska, on 9 Sept. 1917. RT-PCR with primers specific for the H1 subtype gave a positive signal from the 1917 brant goose.*\n",

    "*The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., has several thousand preserved bird specimens from the early part of the 20th century. Wild waterfowl collected by Smithsonian Institution researchers between 1915 and 1920, cataloged and preserved in ethanol, were used for the study.*\n",
