4. [Data-drive story telling](https://github.com/DiSSCo/demo/blob/master/notebooks/data-driven-story.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook uses specimen and collector data to explore how data elements are connected or not-connected. How can these connections help us tell stories about the object and various actors? This demo was part of the [DARIAH Annual Event, 2022](https://annualevent.dariah.eu/programme/) in the session entitled *Data-Driven storytelling through FAIR data: The challenges in discoverability, cross-domain linking and integrating context.
